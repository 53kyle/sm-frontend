# Social Media Front End

This app is a simplified example of a social media website. Based on the original concept of Twitter, posts are limited to 140 characters, and users can only post text - no photos. 

As a bonus feature, the following tab _genuinely_ only shows posts and reposts by people you follow.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
